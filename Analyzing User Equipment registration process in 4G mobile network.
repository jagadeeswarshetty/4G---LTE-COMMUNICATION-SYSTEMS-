security mode command. 
7. In Wireshark after applying s1ap filter, select Uplink NAS Transport, 
security mode complete.


Some Important Questions 
1. Describe RACH preambles? 
Ans. RACH preambles are random access signals used by devices to initiate communication 
with a cellular network. 
2. Interpret Globally Unique Temporary Identifier (GUTI). 
Ans. A Globally Unique Temporary Identifier (GUTI) is a temporary identifier assigned 
to a mobile device to protect its privacy during network communication. 
3. Identify the initial UE message from eNB to MME. 
Ans.it is a initial context setup request 
4. Outline the MME communicates to HSS. 
Ans. The MME communicates with the HSS (Home Subscriber Server) 
primarily through the Diameter protocol for operations such as 
authentication, authorization, and retrieving subscriber information. 
5. Outline the Authentication Response message. 
Ans. It is to confirm the success of the authentication process, 
including the results of the authentication calculations and any necessary security parameters. 
6. Differentiate encryption and integrity protection algorithms. 
Page | 16 
Ans.the encryption algorithm can protect the confidentialty of data by converting into unreadable format  
the integrity algorithm is used to protect the  data has not been altered by verifying its authenticity and integrity 
through checksums or hashes. 
7. Relate integrity protection and its importance. 
Ans. Integrity protection ensures that data has not been tampered with during transmission,  
safeguarding its accuracy and authenticity, which is crucial for maintaining trust and security  
in communication systems. 
8. Illustrate the features of NAS. 
Ans. 
• Session management 
• Mobilty management 
• Connection management  
• Authentication and security 
• Bearer management
